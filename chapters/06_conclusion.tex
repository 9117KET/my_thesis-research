\subsection{Key Findings}
\label{subsec:key-findings}

The comparative evaluation revealed several key advantages and important trade-offs of our ontology-enhanced approach:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Substantial Hallucination Reduction:} Our system demonstrated a 75\% reduction in hallucinations (from 26.67\% to 6.67\%) compared to standard LLMs when explaining complex STEM concepts, with a medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.528)
    
    \item \textbf{Accuracy-Hallucination Trade-off:} An unexpected finding was the inverse relationship between hallucination reduction and answer accuracy, with model accuracy decreasing from 86.67\% to 46.67\% despite improved factual reliability
    
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Explanation Quality:} Visual comparisons show how our system more effectively identifies and addresses common student misconceptions in physics, with particular strength in generating explanations rather than in multiple-choice assessment
    
    \item \textbf{Context-Dependent Performance:} Examples demonstrate that the ontology-enhanced system performs better for explanation generation than for assessment tasks, suggesting domain-specific applications may be optimal

\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:concluding-remarks}

This thesis has demonstrated the significant potential of combining ontological knowledge with LLMs in STEM education~\cite{mendel2024hypercubes}. Through comprehensive evaluation, we have shown that our approach substantially reduces hallucinations by 75\% compared to standard LLMs~\cite{rivera2024impact}, while also revealing an important accuracy-hallucination trade-off that has significant implications for educational applications.

The unexpected inverse relationship between hallucination reduction and answer accuracy highlights the complexity of applying knowledge constraints to LLMs. This finding suggests that different educational tasks may benefit from varying levels of ontological constraint, with explanation generation benefiting more than assessment tasks. This nuanced understanding of how to effectively integrate symbolic and neural approaches will be crucial for the development of AI educational systems that balance factual reliability with flexible reasoning.

As AI continues to evolve, the principles, methodologies, and trade-offs established in this research will contribute to the ongoing development of more effective and reliable educational technologies. The strategic application of ontological constraints based on specific educational goals holds great promise for the future of STEM education, potentially leading to systems that can dynamically adjust their knowledge integration approach based on the specific learning context and objective. As we move forward, continued research into balancing these competing factors will play a crucial role in making quality STEM education more accessible, accurate, and effective for learners worldwide.
