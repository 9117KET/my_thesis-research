\section{Research Overview}
\label{sec:research-overview}

This thesis investigated the integration of ontological knowledge with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance STEM education~\cite{doubletaken2024llm}. Our research addressed three key challenges in AI-powered education:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Knowledge accuracy and consistency in LLM responses
    \item Personalization of learning experiences
    \item Scalability of AI tutoring systems
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary of Contributions}
\label{sec:contributions}

Our research has made several important contributions to the field of AI in education:

\subsection{Technical and Educational Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Novel Architecture:} Development of an ontology-enhanced LLM system that significantly reduces hallucination rates by 75\%.
    \item \textbf{Knowledge Integration:} Implementation of a knowledge base (Physics Ontology) integration mechanism that maintains context consistency across conversations and improves explanation quality.
    \item \textbf{Misconception Handling:} Implementation of effective strategies for identifying and correcting common physics misconceptions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}
\label{subsec:comparison-methodology}

Our evaluation methodology involved

\begin{itemize}
    \item Selection of representative STEM educational queries across varying complexity levels
    \item Generation of responses from both our ontology-enhanced LLM and standard LLMs (without ontology integration)
    \item Documentation of responses through screenshots to capture the exact output format and content
    \item Qualitative and quantitative analysis of response differences (accuracy, hallucination rate, explanation quality)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Findings}
\label{subsec:key-findings}

The comparative evaluation revealed several key advantages and important trade-offs of our ontology-enhanced approach:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Substantial Hallucination Reduction:} Our system demonstrated a 75\% reduction in hallucinations (from 26.67\% to 6.67\%) compared to standard LLMs when explaining complex STEM concepts (from the Force Concept Inventory), with a medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.528)
    
    \item \textbf{Accuracy-Hallucination Trade-off:} An unexpected finding was the inverse relationship between hallucination reduction and answer accuracy, with model accuracy decreasing from 86.67\% to 46.67\% despite improved factual reliability (due to constraints on the ontology model due to system prompt and ontology constraints)
    
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Explanation Quality:} Visual comparisons show how our system more effectively identifies and addresses common student misconceptions in physics, with particular strength in generating explanations rather than in multiple-choice assessment (except explicitly fed with multiple choice questions)
    
    \item \textbf{Context-Dependent Performance:} Examples demonstrate that the ontology-enhanced system performs better for explanation generation than for assessment tasks, suggesting domain-specific applications may be optimal
\end{itemize}



\section{Impact and Implications}
\label{sec:impact}

The implications of this research extend across several domains:

\subsection{Educational Technology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Advancement in AI-powered tutoring systems
    \item New for guiding an output of an LLM to be more accurate and less hallucinating
    \item Personalized learning process for LLMs
    \item Enhanced accessibility of quality STEM education
\end{itemize}

\subsection{AI Development}
\begin{itemize}
    \item New approaches for combining symbolic and neural methods
    \item Improved techniques for knowledge integration in LLMs
    \item Enhanced methods for context management in AI systems
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations and Challenges}
\label{sec:limitations}

While our research has shown promising results, several limitations should be acknowledged:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Accuracy-Hallucination Trade-off:} Our evaluation revealed that while hallucinations decreased by 75\%, answer accuracy also decreased significantly (from 86.67\% to 46.67\%), suggesting that ontological constraints may sometimes be overly restrictive
    
    \item \textbf{Statistical Power:} The marginally significant p-value (p = 0.082) suggests the need for more extensive evaluation with larger samples to confirm observed patterns
    
    \item \textbf{Domain Scope:} Current implementation limited to specific physics concepts with varying effectiveness across different question types (according to the Force Concept Inventory)
    
    \item \textbf{Computational Resources:} Resource requirements for concurrent user scaling, especially with real-time ontology verification
    
    \item \textbf{Knowledge Base Maintenance:} Need for regular ontology updates and maintenance to ensure ongoing accuracy
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Research Directions}
\label{sec:future-work}

Based on recent developments in educational AI research and the accuracy-hallucination trade-off identified in our evaluation, we identify several promising directions for future work:

\subsection{Technical Advancements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Balancing Constraints and Accuracy:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Development of adaptive constraint mechanisms that adjust based on task type (multiple choice questions vs explanation generation)
            \item Exploration of hybrid approaches that apply ontology constraints selectively
            \item Research into how to best integrate ontological knowledge into LLMs to maintain accuracy while reducing hallucinations
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Extended Domain Coverage:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Expansion to other STEM subjects with varying knowledge structures (Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science, Engineering, etc)
            \item Integration of cross-domain knowledge with appropriate constraint levels
            \item Development of domain-specific ontologies optimized for different educational tasks
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:concluding-remarks}

This thesis has demonstrated the significant potential of combining ontological knowledge with LLMs in STEM education. Through comprehensive evaluation, we have shown that our approach substantially reduces hallucinations by 75\% compared to standard LLMs~\cite{rivera2024impact}, while also revealing an important accuracy-hallucination trade-off that has significant implications for educational applications.

The unexpected inverse relationship between hallucination reduction and answer accuracy highlights the complexity of applying knowledge constraints to LLMs. This finding suggests that different educational tasks may benefit from varying levels of ontological constraint, with explanation generation benefiting more than assessment tasks. This understanding of how to effectively integrate symbolic and neural approaches will be crucial for the development of AI educational systems that balance factual reliability with flexible reasoning.

As AI continues to evolve, the principles, methodologies, and trade-offs established in this research will contribute to the ongoing development of more effective and reliable educational technologies. The application of ontological constraints based on specific educational goals holds great promise for the future of STEM education, potentially leading to systems that can dynamically adjust their knowledge integration approach based on the specific learning context, student understanding level and overall objective of the institution.
