Background
The integration of ontology models into Large Language Models (LLMs) is gaining attention as a potential solution to address various challenges associated with LLMs, particularly in the context of STEM education. These challenges include hallucinations, bias, black-box reasoning, and a lack of domain depth[1]

[2]

. Hallucinations, which refer to the generation of incorrect or nonsensical information by LLMs, pose significant obstacles to their reliability and usability in educational settings. Studies suggest that the incorporation of external sources and structured ontologies can help mitigate these hallucination metrics, ultimately enhancing the contextual accuracy and dependability of AI-generated responses[3]

[4]

[5]

. Ontology models serve as frameworks for knowledge representation, allowing AI systems to disambiguate terms and interpret language meaningfully[6]

. The ontological model can significantly improve the precision of AI-generated outputs by providing necessary contextual cues that guide the LLM's understanding of complex topics[7]

[8]

. Moreover, LLMs like GPT-4 and Mistral have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks such as text summarization and content generation. However, their application in ontology generation remains underexplored due to the inherent requirement for a deep understanding of structure, logic, and domain-specific knowledge[8]

[9]

. Without adequate domain-specific training, pre-trained LLMs struggle to deliver the precision and relevance necessary for effective ontology generation in STEM fields. Research indicates that there are three broad approaches to mitigating hallucinations in LLMs: prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and grounding with external knowledge sources[4]

[2]

. Among these, the use of sophisticated knowledge representations, such as ontologies, has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing the contextual reasoning of LLMs in educational applications[10]

[2]

[5]

. By employing structured thought instilled through ontology integration, it is believed that LLMs can achieve higher accuracy and reliability, paving the way for more effective applications in STEM education.

Ontology Models
Ontology models serve as foundational structures for organizing and contextualizing knowledge within various domains, including education and artificial intelligence. An ontology is defined as a data model that articulates the relationships among multiple taxonomies, thereby providing a consistent representation of data and their interrelations, which is essential for informing and powering AI technologies[11]

[12]

[13]

. By establishing clear definitions of concepts and the relationships between them, ontologies enable systems to achieve contextual understanding and reasoning[6]

[14]

.

Structure and Purpose of Ontologies
Ontologies are structured representations of knowledge that define key concepts, properties of these concepts, and their interrelations within a specific domain[15]

[16]

. They are particularly beneficial for automatic machine processing of domain knowledge, allowing AI systems to disambiguate terms and interpret language accurately[6]

[17]

. This structured format is vital for enhancing explainability and improving data management in AI systems, particularly in educational settings[18]

[19]

. For instance, ontologies can effectively capture the diverse aspects of a learning domain by specifying all relevant concepts, thus fostering a more tailored educational experience[19]

[20]

.

Application in AI and Education
The role of ontology models is crucial in the context of AI, especially as Large Language Models (LLMs) become more prevalent. Ontologies facilitate the integration of structured knowledge into LLMs, which helps reduce issues such as hallucination—where models generate incorrect or nonsensical information[21]

. By utilizing ontology-based frameworks, AI systems can maintain consistency and enhance their reasoning capabilities across different platforms, enabling better communication and knowledge sharing[15]

[16]

. In educational contexts, ontology models not only enhance the representation of learning domains but also support the automatic generation of ontologies through machine learning techniques[22]

[23]

. This capability allows educators and systems to refine and adapt educational content dynamically based on the structured understanding that ontologies provide[18]

.

Ontology Learning and Future Directions
Recent advancements in ontology learning leverage the capabilities of LLMs to automate or semi-automate the development of ontologies, especially within the context of big data[24]

[25]

. This ongoing research underscores the importance of ontologies as engines of discovery, as they empower AI systems to process and interpret vast amounts of information effectively. As the landscape of AI continues to evolve, the integration of ontology models in AI systems promises to enhance contextual reasoning and reduce ambiguity, particularly in STEM education where clarity and precision are paramount[21]

[18]

.

Hallucination in Large Language Models
Hallucination in the context of large language models (LLMs) refers to the phenomenon where these models generate information that is factually incorrect or entirely fabricated, delivering it with apparent conviction[26]

[27]

. This issue has become a significant focal point in natural language processing, with various methodologies proposed and evaluated to mitigate its effects[28]

[29]

.

Causes of Hallucinations
Several factors contribute to hallucinations in LLMs. Primarily, the models are heavily influenced by the datasets on which they are trained. If these datasets contain inadequate, conflicting, or misleading information, the model may inadvertently produce false outputs[30]

[31]

. Additionally, LLMs do not possess the capability to seek out current or additional information beyond what they were trained on, which limits their reliability when answering questions about recent events or complex topics[27]

[31]

. Furthermore, the intrinsic limitations of model architectures can also lead to hallucinations, as they may not perfectly represent all computable functions[18]

.

Mitigation Strategies
To address the hallucination issue, researchers have explored three broad approaches: prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and grounding[4]

.

Prompt Engineering: This involves strategically crafting input prompts to guide the model toward generating more accurate responses. For instance, enriched prompts can provide context or specify desired output formats, which can help minimize hallucinations[32]

.
Fine-Tuning: This method entails retraining the model on curated datasets that emphasize accuracy and reduce the prevalence of misleading information[28]

. However, the practicality of continuously updating models in real-time remains a challenge due to associated costs[30]

.
Grounding with Ontologies: Integrating formal ontologies into LLMs can enhance their contextual reasoning abilities. Ontologies define key concepts within a domain and the relationships among them, enabling models to make more informed inferences based on structured knowledge[33]

[15]

. This approach can aid in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) processes, addressing hallucination issues by providing a reliable framework for knowledge representation[34]

[11]

.
Recent Findings
Recent studies suggest that inference techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Search Augmented Generation can effectively reduce hallucinations by allowing models to reflect on their reasoning processes and access more relevant information dynamically[35]

. By improving the underlying mechanisms of LLMs and leveraging structured knowledge, researchers aim to create more reliable and accurate AI systems capable of supporting complex tasks in fields such as STEM education[36]

.

Methodology
Overview
This study aims to enhance the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in the context of STEM education by fine-tuning these models on carefully curated datasets derived from foundational texts in ontology engineering (OE). The focus is on generating high-quality, domain-specific ontologies that align with the conceptual and structural needs of the educational sector.

Can fine-tuning LLMs for OE concepts significantly improve their performance, enabling them to produce outputs with higher accuracy and adherence to ontology syntax?
Does the integration of domain-specific datasets into the fine-tuning process enhance the practical utility of the generated ontologies, particularly in real-world applications?
Dataset Creation and Automation
To achieve these objectives, the study incorporates automated methods for dataset creation.

Consistency
Manually created datasets can exhibit variability in quality and structure, which may stem from individual interpretations and methods of data extraction. By utilizing LLMs for automation, the study ensures a consistent format and quality across all datasets, thus enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of the model training process[9]

[37]

.

Speed
The automation of dataset creation significantly accelerates the process. LLMs can swiftly process extensive texts, extracting relevant information and structuring it into the required format much faster than manual methods, thereby saving valuable time and resources[9]

[21]

.

Resource Optimization
By automating routine data extraction and formatting tasks, the study allows valuable human resources to be redirected towards more complex and strategic tasks. This includes refining the models' architecture, configuring hyperparameters, and analyzing outcomes[9]

[21]

[37]

.

Implementation Steps
The implementation of automated dataset creation involves several systematic steps, ensuring that the data used for fine-tuning is both relevant and robust. The details of these steps are crucial for developing ontologies that effectively support the educational objectives identified in this research.

Findings
Hallucination Reduction in LLMs
Recent research indicates that inference techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Search Augmented Generation have shown promise in significantly reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs)[35]

. Hallucination, defined as the generation of factually incorrect or entirely fabricated information by LLMs, poses a significant challenge in the deployment of these models across various domains[26]

[18]

. By implementing strategies like increasing the number of iterations during model training, researchers have observed an effective mitigation of hallucination occurrences[38]

.

Role of Ontologies in Enhancing LLMs
The integration of ontologies into LLM frameworks has been proposed as a means to enhance contextual reasoning and improve the accuracy of generated content. Ontologies provide structured frameworks that facilitate the understanding of context and semantic meaning, enabling AI systems to disambiguate terms and accurately interpret language[6]

. Studies suggest that while LLMs cannot fully replace formal ontologies, they can assist in sub-tasks such as suggesting candidate terms or drafting definitions that human experts can refine[39]

[40]

. This collaborative approach not only enriches the ontology design process but also aids in ontology alignment, allowing for the identification of equivalences across different knowledge domains[41]

.

Improvements in Ontology-Driven Models
Empirical results have demonstrated that incorporating ontology-driven methodologies leads to improvements in the functional output of LLMs. The second fine-tuning iteration of models showed a better alignment with task requirements, suggesting a more stable and contextually appropriate representation of the ontology[42]

[43]

. The introduction of more coherent classes within the ontology resulted in enhanced conceptual mapping of key domain elements, thereby improving the qualitative aspects of the model’s performance, despite not significantly changing quantitative metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score[44]

[42]

.

Student Models and Contextual Relevance
In educational contexts, ontologies serve multiple roles, primarily focusing on student models and learning objects. Feedback mechanisms and context data also play crucial roles in the application of ontologies within STEM education, reinforcing the importance of contextual relevance in enhancing the educational experience[28]

. As LLMs continue to evolve, the interplay between ontology integration and contextual reasoning is expected to facilitate a more effective learning environment, reducing inaccuracies and improving knowledge retention among learners.

Discussion
The integration of ontologies into large language models (LLMs) represents a promising approach to enhancing contextual reasoning, particularly within the realm of STEM education. By proposing an alternative ontological conceptualization of relevance, it becomes evident that the implications extend beyond mere outcomes and impact, suggesting a deeper philosophical framework for understanding educational contexts[30]

. Recent explorations have demonstrated the robustness of reasoning and problem-solving capabilities in LLMs, particularly when enriched with domain-specific knowledge, such as that derived from Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. These datasets can significantly improve the models’ contextual understanding and allow them to generate more realistic ontologies, which in turn refines their outputs and makes them more relevant to real-world applications[45]

[46]

. Moreover, expanding the scope of competency questions facilitates a more intricate exploration of relationships within the data, guiding models toward improved precision and recall, thereby addressing the often-cited issue of LLM hallucinations[46]

[47]

. Additionally, the use of shared ontologies has been exemplified in a tool framework that aids educators in managing science information models. This framework not only illustrates the practical application of ontologies in educational settings but also underscores the importance of teachers' perceptions and readiness in shaping effective STEM education practices[48]

[49]

. Empirical evidence suggests that teachers' attitudes, influenced by their preparedness, significantly predict the outcomes of STEM educational strategies[50]

. Moreover, the sequential mixed methods study applied to integrated STEM teacher identity underscores the necessity of a multifaceted approach that incorporates teacher training and ontology integration to establish and maintain a STEM identity among students[51]

. As educational researchers have noted, fostering an interest in STEM subjects is critical to developing students' identities within these fields, making it imperative to harness both ontological frameworks and teacher engagement in the learning process[52]

[53]

. To further address the challenges in ontology-enhanced reasoning, future research should critically assess the strengths and limitations of these models. Emphasizing the need for hybrid solutions and domain-specific training data can enhance models' contextual understanding, allowing them to emulate human expertise more effectively. This approach will likely lead to the development of more sophisticated educational tools that not only assist instructors but also empower students in their learning journeys[14]

[47]

[42]

. Ultimately, by bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical applications, ontology-enhanced models hold significant potential to transform STEM education and reduce instances of LLM hallucinations.
